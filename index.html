            I want to use this project to advocate for people to be more patient
            with their family members, calm down and think before responding,
            and love each other.

          I am always intrigued by games that mislead the users into making
          choices that might lead to a not-so-great ending (false ending). With
          this idea and the want to do something related to family relations and
          tensions, I wanted to create something that provokes reflection for
          the users. The game starts with a tutorial that encourages fight and
          portrays the family as a fighting arena. The user would be misled into
          wanting to win the game by saying negative things towards the
          opponent. They win the argument, but they will soon realize that they
          lost the game because they hurt the family member. They will have to
          realize that they need to wait for the timer to run out and a hidden
          option appears. The option is a calmer response (physically not
          shaking when hovered). That will unlock the good ending.

          This project is inspired by the booming of short form videos
          especially during Covid. The attntion span reduces significantly as
          the generations progress in society. As someone who is deeply affected
          by this issue, I really wanted to make a project that mimics the
          experience and make the audience realize how much time they ight be
          wasting on the day-to-day scrolling. I hope people will do more things
          out of the phone and truly experience life.

          "Black Gooey Universe" seemed like an innocent discussion of the
          history of the graphical user interface at a glance, however, reading
          more closely, the passage and the artist are constantly questioning
          the status quo of the "white" GUI in replacement of the original
          "black" GUI, and acts as a metaphor of the real world class division
          and loss of voice from the black population specifically in the tech
          industry. It is important to constantly reflect the bigger context of
          significant design choices and their implications. It's also
          interesting to see the article point out the separation between
          programmers and ordinary users from using the black and white screens
          as the computers nowadays come with dark and light mode, and sometime
          using light mode in certain applications will be looked down upon.

            WHOM are we designing for? How do we make sure it is usable for our
            targetted audience? What can we do for products that have existing
            biases?

        <p>
          From reading the article by Jenny, I was taken on a journey of the
          Internet and other technologies through the different ways of
          introducing them to the general public. It was a very nostalgic piece
          with a lot of personal experience intertwined in the history of
          technology. This article was written in 2016, even before the boom of
          short video forms and social media saturation. Looking back on her
          example of Rando being an app allowing people to look into others'
          lives with the booming use of BeReal (or rather, BeFake), it's
          interesting that the functionalities of both apps are essentially the
          same, but the effect of them are totally different. Rando was all
          about spontaneous and connecting strangers, while BeReal was about
          keeping up with friends and showing them fragments of your life.
          Looking at the picture of a toilet, I chuckled, thinking that this
          type of picture will probably never appear on BeReal. Why is that? Is
          it because of the audience in the change of time? I am also a little
          sad from reading the article now 😦

        <p>
          I really enjoyed the presentation by Lauren McCarthy. I am amazed by
          her ideas and how she executes those ideas into art projects. My
          favorite is the "Follow" project, the duality of virtual followers and
          followers in real life as well as the duality of a creepy stalker and
          a "innocent" follower is very interesting. Her project reveals the
          conflicting feeling of both needing to be watched and the fear of
          being watched. In this presentation from 2019, the issues are more
          prevalent than before as social media grows larger and popular. It is
          fun to see real people trying to replace Artificial Intelligence as an
          experiment of what people want their relationship with personal
          assistants is like. As technology advances, humans are more reliant on
          technology and workers are being replaced, Lauren McCarthy's work
          tries to explore the possibility of having the primitive humanistic
          relationships and asking if AI is the best solution when people crave
          human interactions instead of mechanical ones.

        <summary>Memes and overcompressed</summary>
        <p>
          This week's reading is really interesting as it tries to identify a
          purpose behind over-compressed images that are exchanged across the
          web every second. There is a saying in China called 包浆, which is
          originally a jargon in antique collectivist, meaning the antique has a
          long history so that its surface is covered in a oxidized layer. In
          the context of online images, the term laughs at the images that have
          been re-uploaded so many times that the images have such poor quality.
          It is often seen as a compliment that the image is very popular hence
          why it is being re-uploaded so many times. As the article refers back
          many times: the poor images are not about the original message
          anymore, but instead, about its appropriations and exploitation. It is
          taken out of its original context and given a new meaning that is more
          temporal with the online audience. It can be edited and modified
          easily with the help of modern technology. It transfers the ownerships
          from a singular source to anyone who wants to modify it, making the
          knowledge decentralized.

          As Artificial Intelligence technology develops rapidly, more and more
          parameters get passed into large language models, it is important to
          consider AI ethics and its data diversity. Training data is always
          very important for AI to learn about the world we are living in.
          However, I sometimes wonder, is it really possible for an AI to be
          "omniscent" in a sense and really become unbiased completely? There
          are so many different people, different opinions in the world, who
          gets to define an "objectivity"? Would it be better for us just to
          accept that AIs are regional and have bias, just like humans, so we
          won't have one common source of truth, when we will never be sure that
          it understands everything in the big wide world? When one bias is
          fought, are there other biases we neglected throughout the process? In
          the call for action, Joy asked the audience to take action by
          uploading selfies to help diversify the data source for the facial
          recognition model. But linking it back to data privacy from week 4's
          reading, how secure are those data? How do we separate, or would we
          ever be able to separate private lives and mere data inputs into a
          cold AI machine?

          When the Professor showed the slide of "Land Acknowledgement", I was
          very surprised as it was my first time hearing this powerful statement
          in a class. I think it is really important to acknowledge the
          significance of the people who really "own" the land. And I was then
          also reflective on the fact that this class was the only class that
          mentions this, which links to the "single story" TED talk, as our
          education system seems to have a very one-sided narrative that does
          not give enough importance to the history of the native lands. That is
          dangerous as we might lose the heritage of those native lands where
          they have a lack of examples in literature and learning resources. As
          a computer science student, we often talk about efficiency and how to
          save resources from a perspective of cost, rarely about actual spacial
          influence and effects on people in the construction of those physical
          objects.

          list started off to be: only 12 people, and how big it grew today:
          "8,500 members from more than 65 countries". It is truly amazing to
          see how much a group of strongly willed people can do, and the power
          of community. It now also has a Discord, not just a email list, which
          might be a reason why it is still active today: it is adapting to new
          environments and technologies, unafraid of the challenge that this
          fast-changing society is bringing it, but embracing it, and using it
          as its advantage.

          I am always intrigued by the rich culture and community of ASL. I love
          how Kim transform such a visual language into visual artwork, but at
          the same time have such rich rhythm and sound. She touches on one of
          the topics we have discussed before: non-linear narrative. She says
          that ASL is very non-linear while spoken language is more linear. I
          think spoken language also has similar non-linear properties like ASL,
          as we take body language and expressions into account as well.
          However, ASL is indeed more expressive in the body language and look
          more performative and vibrant. It is an art within itself.
