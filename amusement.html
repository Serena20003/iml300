      We were keeping our eye on .1984.  When the year came and the prophecy
didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves.  the
roots of liberal democracy had held.  Wherever else the terror had
happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was
another--slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling:
Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.  Contrary to common belief even among
the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing.  Orwell
warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression.  But
in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of
their autonomy, maturity and history.  As he saw it, people will come to
love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their
capacities to think.
What Orwell feared were those who would ban books.  What Huxley feared
was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no
one who wanted to read one.  Orwell feared those who would deprive us of
information.  Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we
would be reduced to passivity and egoism.  Orwell feared that the truth
would be concealed from us.  Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in
a sea of irrelevance.  Orwell feared we would become a captive culture.
Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some
equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal
bumblepuppy.  As Huxley re
marked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and
rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take
into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984,
Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain.  In Brave New
World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure.  In short, Orwell
feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love
will ruin us.
This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.
Part I.

    </h1>
    <div style="width: 70vw;">
      <p>
At different times in our historY, different cities have been the focal point of a radiating American spirit. In the late eighteenth centurY, for example, Boston was the center of a political radicalism that ignited a shot heard round the world--a shot that could not have been fired any other place but the suburbs of Boston. At its report, all Americans, including Virginians,, became Bostonians at heart. In the mid-nineteenth centurY, New York became the symbol of the idea of a melting-pot America--or at least a non-English one--as the wretched refuse from all over the world disembarked at Ellis Island and spread over the land their strange languages and even stranger ways. In the early twentieth centurY, Chicago, the city of big shoulders and heavy winds, came to symbolize the industrial energy and dynamism of America. If there is-a statue of a hog butcher somewhere in Chicago, then it stands as a reminder of the time when America was railroads, cattle, steel mills and entrepreneurial adventures. If there is no such statue, there ought to be, just as there is a statue of a Minute Man to recall the Age of Boston, as the Statue of Liberty recalls the Age of New York.

Today, we must look to the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, as a metaphor of
our national character and aspiration, its symbol a thirty-foot-high
cardboard picture of a slot machine and a chorus girl.  For Las Vegas is
a city entirely devoted to the idea of entertainment, and as such
proclaims the spirit of a culture in which all public discourse
increasingly takes the form of entertainment. Our politics, religion,
news, athletics, education and
commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business,
largely without protest or even much popular notice.  the result is that
we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death. As I write,
the President of the United States is a former Hollywood movie actor.
One of his principal challengers in 1984 was once a featured player on
television's most glamorous show of the 1960s that is to say, an
astronaut.  Naturally, a movie has been made about his extraterrestrial
adventure.  Former nominee George McGovern has hosted the popular
television show "Saturday Night Live." So has a candidate of more recent
vintage, the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Meanwhile, former President Richard
Nixon, who once claimed he lost an election because he was sabotaged by
makeup men, has offered Senator Edward Kennedy advice on how to make a
serious run for the presidency: lose twenty pounds.  Although the
Constitution makes no mention of it, it would appear that fat people are
now effectively excluded from running for high political office.
Probably bald people as well.  Almost certainly those whose looks are
not significantly enhanced by the cosmetician's art.  Indeed, we may
have reached the point where cosmetics has replaced ideology as the
field of expertise over which a politician must have competent control.
America's journalists, i.e., television newscasters, have not missed the
point.  Most spend more time with their hair dryers than with their
scripts, with the result that they comprise the most glamorous group of
people this side of Las Vegas.  Although the Federal Communications Act
makes no mention of it, those without camera appeal are excluded from
addressing the public about what is called "the news of the day." Those
with camera appeal can command salaries exceeding one million dollars a
year. American businessmen discovered, long before the rest of us, that
the quality and usefulness of their goods are subordinate to the
artifice of their display; that, in fact, half the principles of
the <a href="/congrats.html">Medium</a> Is the Metaphor
capitalism as praised by Adam Smith or condemned by Karl Marx are
irrelevant.  Even the Japanese, who are said to make better cars than
the Americans, know that economics is less a science than a performing
art, as Toyota's yearly advertising budget confirms. Not long ago, I saw

Billy Graham join with Shecky Green Red Buttons, Dionne Warwick, Milton
Berle and other theologians in a tribute to George Burns, who was
celebrating himself for surviving eighty years in show business.  the
Reverend Graham exchanged one-liners with Burns about making
preparations for Eternity.  Although the Bible makes no mention of it,
the Reverend Graham assured the audience that God loves those who make
people laugh.  It was an honest mistake.  He merely mistook NBC for God.
Dr.  Ruth Westheimer is a psychologist who has a popular radio program
and a nightclub act in which she informs her audiences about sex in all
of its infinite variety and in language once reserved for the bedroom
and street corners.  She is almost as entertaining as the Reverend Billy
Graham, and has been quoted as saying, "I don't start out to be funny.
But if it comes out that way, I use it.  If they call me an entertainer,
I say that's great.  When a professor teaches with a sense of humor,
people walk away remembering." She did not say what they remember or of
what use their remembering is.  But she has a point: It's great to be an
entertainer.  Indeed, in America God favors all those who possess both a
talent and a format to amuse, whether they be preachers, athletes,
entrepreneurs, politicians, teachers or journalists.  In America, the
least amusing people are its professional entertainers. Culture watchers
and worriers--those of the type who read books like this one--will know
that the examples above are not aberrations but, in fact, clichs.  There
is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution
of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show
business. But most of them, I believe, have barely begun to tell the
story of the origin and.  meaning of this descent into a vast
triviality. Those who have written vigorously on the matter tell us, for
example, that what is happening is the residue of an exhausted
capitalism; or, on the contrary, that it is the tasteless fruit of the
maturing of capitalism; or that it is the neurotic aftermath of the Age
of Freud; or the retribution of our allowing God to perish; or that it
all comes from the old stand-bys, greed and ambition. I have attended
carefully to these explanations, and I do not say there is nothing to
learn from them.  Marxists, Freudians, Levi-Straussians, even Creation
Scientists are not to be taken lightly.  And, in any case, I should be
very surprised if the story I have to tell is anywhere near the whole
truth.  We are all, as Huxley says someplace, Great Abbreviators,
meaning that none of us has the wit to know the whole truth, the time to
tell it if we believed we did, or an audience so gullible as to accept
it. But you will find an argument here that presumes a clearer grasp of
the matter than many that have come before.  Its value, such as it is,
resides in the directness of its perspective, which has its origins in
observations made 2,300 years ago by Plato.  It is an argument that

fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates
that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the
strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express.
And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important
content of a culture.
I use the word "conversation" metaphorically to refer not only to speech
but to all techniques and technologies that permit people of a
particular culture to exchange messages.  In this sense, all culture is
a conversation or, more precisely, a corporation of conversations,
conducted in a variety of symbolic modes. Our attention here is on how
forms of public discourse regulate and even dictate what kind of content
can issue from such fOrmS. To take a simple example of what this means,
consider the
primitive technology of smoke signals.  While I do not know exactly what
content was once carried in the smoke signals of American Indians, I can
safely guess that it did not include philosophical argument.  Puffs of
smoke are insufficiently complex to express ideas on the nature of
existence, and even if they were not, a Cherokee philosopher would run
short of either wood or blankets long before he reached his second
axiom.  You cannot use smoke to do philosophy.  Its form excludes the
content. To take an example closer to home: As I suggested earlier, it
is implausible to imagine that anyone like our twenty-seventh President,
the multi-chinned, three-hundred-pound William Howard Taft, could be put
forward as a presidential candidate in today's world.  the shape of a
man's body is largely irrelevant to the shape of his ideas when he is
addressing a public in writing or on the radio or, for that matter, in
smoke signals.  But it is quite relevant on television.  the grossness
of a three-hundred-pound image, even a talking one, would easily
Overwhelm any logical or spiritual subtleties conveyed by speech.  For
on television, discourse is conducted largely through visual imagery,
which is to say that television gives us a conversation in images, not
words.  the emergence of the image-manager in the political arena and
the concomitant decline of the speech writer attest to the fact that
television demands a different kind of content from other media.  You
cannot do political philosophy on television. Its form works against the
content. To give still another example, one of more complexity: the
information, the content, or, if you will, the "stuff" that makes up
what is called "the news of the day" did not exist--could not exist--in
a world that lacked the media to give it expression. I do not mean that
things like fires, wars, murders and love affairs did not, ever and
always, happen in places all over the world.  I mean that lacking a
technology to advertise them, people could not attend to them, could not

include them in their daily business.  Such information simply could not
exist as
part of the content of culture.  This idea--that there is a content
called "the news of the day"--was entirely created by the telegraph (and
since amplified by newer media), which made it possible to move
decontextualized information over vast spaces at incredible speed.  the
news of the day is a figment of our technological imagination.  It is,
quite precisely, a media event. We attend to fragments of events from
all over the world because we have multiple media whose forms are well
suited to fragmented conversation.  Cultures without speed-of-light
media-let us say, cultures in which smoke signals are the most efficient
space-conquering tool available--do not have news of the day.  Without a
<a href="/congrats.html">medium</a> to create its form, the news of the day does not exist. To say
it, then, as plainly as I can, this book is an inquiry into and a
lamentation about the most significant American cultural fact of the
second half of the twentieth century: the decline of the Age of
Typography and the ascendancy of the Age of Television. This change-over
has dramatically and irreversibly shifted the content and meaning of
public discourse, since two media so vastly different cannot accommodate
the same ideas.  As the influence of print wanes, the content of
politics, religion, education, and anything else that comprises public
business must change and be recast in terms that are most suitable to
television. If all of this sounds suspiciously like Marshall McLuhan's
aphorism, the <a href="/congrats.html">medium</a> is the message, I will not disavow the association
(although it is fashionable to do so among respectable scholars who,
were it not for McLuhan, would today be mute).  I met McLuhan thirty
years ago when I was a graduate student and he an unknown English
professor.  I believed then, as I believe now, that he spoke in the
tradition of Orwell and Huxley--that is, as a prophesier, and I have
remained steadfast to his teaching that the clearest way to see through
a culture is to attend to its tools for conversation.  I might add that
my interest in this point of view was first stirred by a prophet far
more
formidable than McLuhan, more ancient than Plato.  In studying the Bible
as a young man, I found intimations of the idea that forms of media
favor particular kinds of content and therefore are capable of taking
command of a culture.  I refer specifically to the Decalogue, the Second
Commandment of which prohibits the Israelites from making concrete
images of anything. "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, any
likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water beneath the earth." I wondered then, as
so many others have, as to why the God of these people would have

included instructions on how they were to symbolize, or not symbolize,
their experience.  It is a strange injunction to include as part of an
ethical system unless its author assumed a connection between forms of
human communication and the quality of a culture.  We may hazard a guess
that a people who are being asked to embrace an abstract, universal
deity would be rendered unfit to do so by the habit of drawing pictures
or making statues or depicting their ideas in any concrete,
icono-graphic forms.  the God of the Jews was to exist in the Word and
through the Word, an unprecedented conception requiring the highest
order of abstract thinking.  Iconography thus became blasphemy so that a
new kind of God could enter a culture. People like ourselves who are in
the process of converting their culture from word-centered to
image-centered might profit by reflecting on this Mosaic injunction. But
even if I am wrong in these conjectures, it is, I believe, a wise and
particularly relevant supposition that the media of communication
available to a culture are a dominant influence on the formation of the
culture's intellectual and social preoccupations. Speech, of course, is
the primal and indispensable <a href="/congrats.html">medium</a>.  It made us human, keeps us human,
and in fact defines what human means.  This is not to say that if there
were no other means of communication all humans would find it equally
convenient to speak about the same things in the same way.  We know
enough about language to understand that variations in the
structures of languages will result in variations in what may be called
"world view." How people think about time and space, and about things
and processes, will be greatly influenced by the grammatical features of
their language.  We dare not suppose therefore that all human minds are
unanimous in understanding how the world is put together.  But how much
more divergence there is in world view among different cultures can be
imagined when we consider the great number and variety of tools for
conversation that go beyond speech.  For although culture is a creation
of speech, it is recreated anew by every <a href="/congrats.html">medium</a> of communication--from
painting to hieroglyphs to the alphabet to television.  Each <a href="/congrats.html">medium</a>,
like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by
providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for
sensibility.  Which, of course, is what McLuhan meant in saying the
<a href="/congrats.html">medium</a> is the message.  His aphorism, however, is in need of amendment
because, as it stands, it may lead one to confuse a message with a
metaphor.  A message denotes a specific, concrete statement about the
world.  But the forms of our media, including the symbols through which
they permit conversation, do not make such statements.  They are rather
like metaphors, working by unobtrusive but powerful implication to
enforce their special definitions of reality.  Whether we are
experiencing the world through the lens of speech or the printed word or

the television camera, our media-metaphors classify the world for us,
sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, color it, argue a case for
what the world is like.  As Ernst Cassirer remarked:
Physical reality seems to recede in proportion as man's symbolic
activity advances.  Instead of dealing with the things themselves man is
in a sense constantly conversing with himself.  He has so enveloped
himself in linguistic forms, in artistic images, in mythical symbols or
religious rites that he cannot see or know anything except by the
interposition of [an] artificial <a href="/congrats.html">medium</a>.
What is peculiar about such interpositions of media is that their role
in directing what we will see or know is so rarely noticed.  A person
who reads a book or who watches television or who glances at his watch
is not usually interested in how his mind is organized and controlled by
these events, still less in what idea of the world is suggested by a
book, television, or a watch.  But there are men and women who have
noticed these things, especially in our own times.  Lewis Mumford, for
example, has been one of our great noticers.  He is not the sort of a
man who looks at a clock merely to see what time it is.  Not that he
lacks interest in the content of clocks, which is of concern to everyone
from moment to moment, but he is far more interested in how a clock
creates the idea of "moment to moment." He attends to the philosophy of
clocks, to clocks as metaphor, about which our education has had little
to say and clock makers nothing at all.  "the clock," Mumford has
concluded, "is a piece of power machinery whose 'product' is seconds and
minutes." In manufacturing such a product, the clock has the effect of
disassociating time from human events and thus nourishes the belief in
an independent world of mathematically measurable sequences.  Moment to
moment, it turns out, is not God's conception, or nature's.  It is man
conversing with himself about and through a piece of machinery he
created. In Mumford's great book Technics and Civilization, he shows
how, beginning in the fourteenth century, the clock made us into
time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers. In the
process, we have learned irreverence toward the sun and the seasons, for
in a world made up of seconds and minutes, the authority of nature is
superseded.  Indeed, as Mumford points out, with the invention of the
clock, Eternity ceased to serve as the measure and focus of human
events.  And thus, though few would have imagined the connection, the
inexorable ticking of the clock may have had more to do with the
weakening of God's supremacy than all the treatises produced by the phi-
losophers of the Enlightenment; that is to' say, the clock introduced a
new form of conversation between man and God, in which God appears to

have been the loser.  Perhaps Moses should have included another
Commandment: Thou shalt not make mechanical representations of time.
That the alphabet introduced a new form of conversation between man and
man is by now a commonplace among scholars. To be able to see one's
utterances rather than only to hear them is no small matter, though our
education, once again, has had little to say about this.  Nonetheless,
it is clear that phonetic writing created a new conception of knowledge,
as well as a new sense of intelligence, of audience and of posterity,
all of which Plato recognized at an early stage in the development of
texts.  "No man of intelligence," he wrote in his Seventh Letter, "will
venture to express his philosophical views in language, especially not
in language that is unchangeable, which is true of that which is set
down in written characters." This notwithstanding, he wrote voluminously
and understood better than anyone else that the setting down of views in
written characters would be the beginning of philosophy, not its end.
Philosophy cannot exist without criticism, and writing makes it possible
and convenient to subject thought to a continuous and concentrated
scrutiny.  Writing freezes speech and in so doing gives birth to the
grammarian, the logician, the rhetorician, the historian, the
scientist--all those who must hold language before them so that they can
see what it means, where it errs, and where it is leading. Plato knew
all of this, which means that he knew that writing would bring about a
perceptual revolution: a shift from the ear to the eye as an organ of
language processing.  Indeed, there is a legend that to encourage such a
shift Plato insisted that his students study geometry before entering
his Academy.  If true, it was a sound idea, for as the great literary
critic Northrop Frye has remarked, "the written word is far more
powerful than simply a reminder: it re-creates the past in the present,
and gives
us, not the familiar remembered thing, but the glittering intensity of
the summoned-up hallucination." 3 All that Plato surmised about the
consequences of writing is now well understood by anthropologists,
especially those who have studied cultures in which speech is the only
source of complex conversation.  Anthropologists know that the written
word, as Northrop Frye meant to suggest, is not merely an echo of a
speaking voice.  It is another kind of voice altogether, a conjurer's
trick of the first order.  It must certainly have appeared that way to
those who invented it, and that is why we should not be surprised that
the Egyptian god Thoth, who is alleged to have brought writing to the
King Thamus, was also the god of magic.  People like ourselves may see
nothing wondrous in writing, but our anthropologists know how strange
and magical it appears to a purely oral people--a conversation with no
one and yet with everyone.  What could be stranger than the silence one

encounters when addressing a question to a text?  What could be more
metaphysically puzzling than addressing an unseen audience, as every
writer of books must do? And correcting oneself because one knows that
an unknown reader will disapprove or misunderstand? I bring all of this
up because what my book is about is how our own tribe is undergoing a
vast and trembling shift from the magic of writing to the magic of
electronics.  What I mean to point out here is that the introduction
into a culture of a technique such as writing or a clock is not merely
an extension of man's power to bind time but a transformation of his way
of thinking--and, of course, of the content of his culture.  And that is
what I mean to say by calling a <a href="/congrats.html">medium</a> a metaphor.  We are told in
school, quite correctly, that a metaphor suggests what a thing is like
by comparing it to something else.  And by the power of its suggestion,
it so fixes a conception in our minds that we cannot imagine the one
thing without the other: Light is a wave; language, a tree; God, a wise
and venerable man; the mind, a dark cavern illuminated by knowledge. And
if these
metaphors no longer serve us, we must, in the nature of the matter, find
others that will.  Light is a particle; language, a river; God (as
Bertrand Russell proclaimed), a differential equation; the mind, a
garden that yearns to be cultivated. But our media-metaphors are not so
explicit or so vivid as these, and they are far more complex.  In
understanding their metaphorical function, we must take into account the
symbolic forms of their information, the source of their information,
the quantity and speed of their information, the context in which their
information is experienced.  Thus, it takes some digging to get at them,
to grasp, for example, that a clock recreates time as an independent,
mathematically precise sequence; that writing recreates the mind as a
tablet on which experience is written; that the telegraph recreates news
as a commodity.  And yet, such digging becomes easier if we start from
the assumption that in every tool we create, an idea is embedded that
goes beyond the function of the thing itself.  It has been pointed out,
for example, that the invention of eyeglasses in the twelfth century not
only made it possible to improve defective vision but suggested the idea
that human beings need not accept as final either the endowments of
nature or the ravages of time.  Eyeglasses refuted the belief that
anatomy is destiny by putting forward the idea that our bodies as well
as our minds are improvable. I do not think it goes too far to say that
there is a link between the invention of eyeglasses in the twelfth
century and gene-splitting research in the twentieth. Even such an
instrument as the microscope, hardly a tool of everyday use, had
embedded within it a quite astonishing idea, not about biology but about
psychology.  By revealing a world hitherto hidden from view, the

microscope suggested a possibility about the structure of the mind. If
things are not what they seem, if microbes lurk, unseen, on and under
our skin, if the invisible controls the visible, then is it not possible
that ids and egos and superegos also lurk somewhere unseen?  What else
is psychoanalysis but a microscope of
the mind?  Where do our notions of mind come from if not from metaphors
generated by our tools?  What does it mean to say that someone has an IQ
of 126?  There are no numbers in people's heads.  Intelligence does not
have quantity or magnitude, except as we believe that it does.  And why
do we believe that it does?  Because we have tools that imply that this
is what the mind is like.  Indeed, our tools for thought suggest to us
what our bodies are like, as when someone refers to her "biological
clock," or when we talk of our "genetic codes," or when we read
someone's face like a book, or when our facial expressions telegraph our
intentions. When Galileo remarked that the language of nature is written
in mathematics, he meant it only as a metaphor.  Nature itself does not
speak.  Neither do our minds or our bodies or, more to the point of this
book, our bodies politic.  Our conversations about nature and about
ourselves are conducted in whatever "languages" we find it possible and
convenient to employ.  We do not see nature or intelligence or human
motivation or ideology as "it" is but only as our languages are.  And
our languages are our media.  Our media are our metaphors.  Our
metaphors create the content of our culture.
